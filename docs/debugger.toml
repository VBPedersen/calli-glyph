name = "Developer Console and Debugging"
description = "The Developer Console is an overlay screen designed to provide a real-time, read-only snapshot of the editor's internal state, action history, and system logs. Its primary purpose is to assist developers/the true developer [GOD] VBPedersen in debugging complex logic, such as cursor positioning, multi-line replacements, and history management, without requiring external print statements or interrupting the main editor loop. It is engineered for zero performance overhead when deactivated.**Note: All listed keybindings are the system defaults and can be customized via the user's .config file.**"

command = ":debug"

description = "Activates the debugger's logging systems. Does not show the console overlay."

[[debugger.commands]]
command = ":debug disable"
keys = "N/A"
description = "Deactivates the debugger's logging systems and clears all collected logs and snapshots from memory, minimizing runtime overhead."

[[debugger.commands]]
command = ":debug console"
keys = "N/A"
description = "Displays the Developer Console overlay, showing real-time state and collected logs/snapshots."

[[debugger.commands]]
command = ":debug toggle"
keys = "N/A"
description = "Toggles the visibility of the Developer Console overlay."

[[debugger.commands]]
command = ":debug clear"
keys = "<c>"
description = "Clears the active log history displayed in the Developer Console, but keeps the debugger system enabled."

[[debugger.commands]]
command = ":debug snapshot"
keys = "N/A"
description = "Captures a single, immediate snapshot of the editor's current internal state (e.g., cursor position, buffer contents, viewports) for later inspection."

description = "Performs a full reset of the debugger state, equivalent to running `:debug disable` then `:debug enable`."

[[debugger.commands]]
command = ":debug mode-frame"
keys = "<m>"
description = "Sets logging mode to 'Frame'. Logs are captured every time the TUI re-renders (highest logging detail, highest overhead)."
